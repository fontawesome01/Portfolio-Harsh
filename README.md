# 🌐 Harsh Rajput — Personal Portfolio

A modern, responsive personal portfolio built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This project showcases my skills, projects, and growth as a developer.

Beyond being a portfolio, this repository also serves as my **Git & GitHub learning playground**, where I continuously improve the codebase through real commits, branches, and feature updates.
