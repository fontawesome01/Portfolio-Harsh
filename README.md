# 🌐 Harsh Rajput — Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This website showcases my skills, projects, and journey as a developer.

It’s not just a portfolio — it’s also my **Git & GitHub learning project**, where I’ll continuously add features, update sections, and track my growth using real commits and branches.
